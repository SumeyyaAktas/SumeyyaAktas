# Hi, I am suak7

<p>I am currently a freshman Computer Science student, aspired to learn more about software development and all things tech! My recent work includes a PyTorch Electron Spin Resonance spectrum analyzer, and Artorias–a custom x86 bootloader with minimal EHCI (USB 2.0) controller support. I particularly enjoy low-level developing and reading emerging research papers on operating systems, especially kernel and device driver development.</p>
