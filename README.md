# Hi, I am suak7
<p>I am currently a freshman Computer Science student at University of Florida, thrilled to learn about machine learning and software development. My recent work includes a PyTorch classifier achieving 95% accuracy on spectral data. I particularly enjoy low-level programming, reading about the inner workings of operating systems, and writing some assembly. I hope to write my own programming language some day!</p>

## Projects
- **Project ESR Spectrum Analyzer** – A PyTorch-based classifier for Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) spectroscopy signals. Built a 3-layer feedforward neural network that distinguishes between three spectral patterns with 95% accuracy. Features custom NumPy signal generation with Gaussian peaks, automated data loading, and performance visualization.

## Skills
- **Programming Languages**: Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **Frameworks & Libraries**: PyTorch, Flask, NumPy, Matplotlib, SQLite
- **Developer Tools**: Git, GitHub, VSCode, Figma
- **Operating Systems**: Process/thread management, CPU scheduling, memory management, file systems, concurrency
