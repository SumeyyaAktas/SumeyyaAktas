# Hi, I am suak7

<p>I am currently a freshman Computer Science student, aspired to pursue low-level programming with a focus on kernel and device driver development! My recent work includes Artorias–a custom 32-bit x86 bootloader with EHCI (USB 2.0) controller support. I am now working on a 64-bit bootloader to integrate AHCI (SATA) storage driver support.</p>

Learn more about me on my [website](<https://suak7.github.io/>)!
