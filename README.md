# Hi, I am suak7 🌊
<p>I am currently a freshman Computer Science student, aspired to learn more about software development and all things tech! My recent work includes a PyTorch classifier achieving 95% accuracy on spectral data. I particularly enjoy low-level programming and reading about the inner workings of operating systems.</p>

## Projects
- **Project ESR Spectrum Analyzer** – A PyTorch-based classifier for Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) spectroscopy signals. Built a 3-layer feedforward neural network that distinguishes between three spectral patterns with 95% accuracy. Features custom NumPy signal generation with Gaussian peaks, automated data loading, and performance visualization.
